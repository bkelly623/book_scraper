# Web Scraper: Book Listings Scraper

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This Python script scrapes book titles, prices, and availability from 
[BooksToScrape.com](https://books.toscrape.com/) using **BeautifulSoup**.

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- Extracts **book titles, prices, and stock availability**.
- Scrapes **multiple pages** automatically.
- Saves the extracted data into a **CSV file** for easy analysis.
- Uses **error handling** to avoid crashes.

# I completed this task a number of times using different criteria. Upon examination of the csv file, I realize that this saved file which I pushed to gitup did not exactly perform as intended, as some of the other attemtps had succeed in returning not only book titles, but also price data, as well as a rating which were converted into number format. For the purpose of this project, I see it fitting to include this in the notes, because although the csv file visible in this depository does not fully display accurate performance, it was not my only attmept at this task.
